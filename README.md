Investigations of a hybrid Gewirtz and Peterson graph

Take a [Gewirtz Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewirtz_graph) which has 56 vertices each with degree 10, and substitite each
Gewirtz vertex with a [Petersen Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen_graph) which has 10 vertices each with degree 3. Each of the
ten Gewirtz edges for a substituted vertex connects to a distinct node of the Petesen graph, such that each of the Petersen vertices goes from
degree three to degree four. This gives a regular graph with 560 vertices of degree 4.

The resulting structure seems quite interesting.
